Having this file exist forces QServ to use HTTP Geolocation. Delete or rename it to use GeoIP instead.
NOTE: it is highly recommeneded to leave this file AS IS, and to use HTTP Geolocation. The GeoIP library
and database included with QServ is deprecated, and outdated and most information is wrong. There is no
need to use GeoIP unless you plan to inplement libmaxmind2, or update the GeoIP database manually.
